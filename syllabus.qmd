## Description {.unnumbered}

This course surveys federal and state laws governing employment, in both the individual and organized labor settings. Topics to be covered include establishing an employment relationship; recruitment & hiring; the scope and limits of supervisory control; confidentiality & competition; wages & hours; employee health & safety; and termination of employment. 

After completing the course, you should be able to recognize and diagnose legal issues arising in the employment context, analyze those issues under the applicable law, and help clients avoid legal problems or pursue remedies when they arise. Simulation problems, including in-class discussion and take-home assignments, provide an opportunity to develop practical skills for representing clients in employment matters.

### Attendance

Elon Law School has adopted the following attendance policy for all courses:

> The Law School administers a policy that a student maintain regular and punctual class attendance in all courses in which the student is registered, including externships, clinical courses, or simulation courses. Faculty members will give students written notice of their attendance policies before or during the first week of class. These policies may include, but are not limited to: treating late arrivals, early departures, and/or lack of preparation as absences  imposing grade or point reductions for absences, including assigning a failing grade or involuntarily withdrawing a student from the class  and any other policies that a professor deems appropriate to create a rigorous and professional classroom environment.
>  
> In case of illness or emergency, students may contact the Office of Student and Professional Life, which will then notify the student’s instructors. A student may notify the faculty member directly of a planned absence and should refer to individual faculty members regarding any policy that may apply. In the case of prolonged illness or incapacity, the student should contact the [Office of Student Life](https://www.elon.edu/u/law/students/).

You should let me know (in advance if feasible) if you are unable to attend class, will arrive late, or must leave early. I do not require an explanation of the reason, nor do I require a doctor's note or other documentation.
