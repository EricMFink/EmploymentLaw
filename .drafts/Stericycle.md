Today, after previously issuing a notice and invitation for briefing, we adopt a new legal standard to decide whether an employer’s work rule that does not expressly restrict employees’ protected concerted activity under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (Act) is facially unlawful under Section 8(a)(1) of the Act. Here, an administrative law judge found that the Respondent violated Section 8(a)(1) by maintaining certain rules for its employees that addressed personal conduct, conflicts of interest, and confidentiality of harassment complaints. In making those findings, the judge applied the standard established by a divided Board in _Boeing Co._, 365 NLRB No. 154 (2017), which sua sponte reversed the standard announced in _Lutheran Heritage Village-Livonia_, 343 NLRB 646 (2004).

Given the ubiquity of work rules and the importance of ensuring that such rules do not operate to undermine employees’ exercise of their rights under the Act, we sought public input on the standard adopted in _Boeing_, then purportedly clarified in _LA Specialty Produce_ Co., 368 NLRB No. 93 (2019), and applied in subsequent cases where the Board found that several types of work rules were categorically lawful for employers to maintain, essentially without regard to how the particular rules were drafted.

Accordingly, we invited the parties and interested amici to address the following questions:

1. Should the Board continue to adhere to the standard adopted in _Boeing Co._ and revised in _LA Specialty Produce Co._?
2. In what respects, if any, should the Board modify existing law addressing the maintenance of employer work rules to better ensure that:
	a. the Board interprets work rules in a way that accounts for the economic dependence of employees on their employers and the related potential for a work rule to chill the exercise of Section 7 rights by employees;
	b. the Board properly allocates the burden of proof in cases challenging an employer’s maintenance of a work rule under Section 8(a)(1); and
	c. the Board appropriately balances employees’ rights under Section 7 and employers’ legitimate business interests?
3. Should the Board continue to hold that certain categories of work rules--such as investigative-confidentiality rules, non-disparagement rules, and rules prohibiting outside employment--are always lawful to maintain?

Having carefully considered the briefs of the parties and amici, as well as the Board’s past experiences regarding these issues and the view of our dissenting colleague, we have decided to adopt an approach to assessing facial challenges to employer work rules under Section 8(a)(1) that builds on and revises the _Lutheran Heritage_ standard. As we will explain, the primary problem with the standard from _Boeing_ and _LA Specialty Produce_ is that it permits employers to adopt overbroad work rules that chill employees’ exercise of their rights under Section 7 of the Act, which include the “right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively . . ., and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.” 29 U.S.C. § 157. To begin, the current standard fails to account for the economic dependency of employees on their employers. Because employees are typically (and understandably) anxious to avoid discharge or discipline, they are reasonably inclined both to construe an ambiguous work rule to prohibit statutorily protected activities and to avoid the risk of violating the rule by engaging in such activity. In turn, _Boeing_ gives too little weight to the burden a work rule could impose on employees’ Section 7 rights. At the same time, _Boeing_’s purported balancing test gives too much weight to employer interests. Crucially, _Boeing_ also condones overbroad work rules by not requiring the party drafting the work rules--the employer--to narrowly tailor its rules to only promote its legitimate and substantial business interests while avoiding burdening employee rights.

The standard we adopt today remedies these fundamental defects. We adopt a modified version of the basic framework set forth in _Lutheran Heritage_, which recognized that overbroad workplace rules and polices may chill employees in the exercise of their Section 7 rights and properly focused the Board’s inquiry on NLRA-protected rights. During the 13 years when the _Lutheran Heritage_ standard was in place, reviewing courts repeatedly and uncontroversially applied and upheld the standard. No court rejected the _Lutheran Heritage_ standard or held that the Board was, in fact, applying some standard other than the one it articulated. However, although _Lutheran Heritage_ implicitly allowed the Board to evaluate employer interests when considering whether a particular rule was unlawfully overbroad, the standard itself did not clearly address how employer interests factored into the Board’s analysis. The modified standard we adopt today makes explicit that an employer can rebut the presumption that a rule is unlawful by proving that it advances legitimate and substantial business interests that cannot be achieved by a more narrowly tailored rule. Because we overrule _Boeing_, _LA Specialty Produce_, and the work rules cases relying on them, including those that placed rules into an “always lawful” category based simply on their subject matter, we reject _Boeing_’s categorical approach, instead returning to a particularized analysis of specific rules, their language, and the employer interests actually invoked to justify them.

As under _Lutheran Heritage_, our standard requires the General Counsel to prove that a challenged rule has a reasonable tendency to chill employees from exercising their Section 7 rights. We clarify that the Board will interpret the rule from the perspective of an employee who is subject to the rule and economically dependent on the employer, and who also contemplates engaging in protected concerted activity. Consistent with this perspective, the employer’s intent in maintaining a rule is immaterial. Rather, if an employee could reasonably interpret the rule to have a coercive meaning, the General Counsel will carry her burden, even if a contrary, noncoercive interpretation of the rule is also reasonable. If the General Counsel carries her burden, the rule is presumptively unlawful, but the employer may rebut that presumption by proving that the rule advances a legitimate and substantial business interest and that the employer is unable to advance that interest with a more narrowly tailored rule. If the employer proves its defense, then the work rule will be found lawful to maintain.

[I.]{.casesection}

Applying Section 8(a)(1) of the Act, the Board has long and consistently recognized that an employer’s mere maintenance of a work rule may unlawfully interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of their Section 7 rights. The Supreme Court long ago confirmed the Board’s authority to regulate employer work rules, as part of the flexibility the Board requires “to accomplish the dominant purpose” of the Act: to protect “the right of employees to organize for mutual aid without employer interference.” Because overbroad and ambiguous work rules may have a coercive effect on employees, the Board and courts have long acknowledged that the regulation of work rules “serves an important prophylactic function: it allows the Board to block rules that might chill the exercise of employees’ rights by cowing the employees into inaction, rather than forcing the Board to ‘wait until that chill is manifest,’ and then try to ‘undertake the difficult task of dispelling it.”’

In its decisions carrying out this important function, the Board has grappled with two interrelated issues. The first has been determining the appropriate interpretive principles to apply in evaluating the potentially deleterious impact of a work rule on employees’ exercise of their Section 7 rights. In doing so, the Board regularly has assessed work rules to determine “the reasonably foreseeable effects of the wording of the rule on the conduct of the employees,” observing that “where the language is ambiguous and may be misinterpreted by the employees in such a way as to cause them to refrain from exercising their statutory rights, then the rule is invalid even if interpreted lawfully by the employer in practice.” The second issue for the Board has been determining how to ensure that the rule minimizes any potential impact on employee rights, notwithstanding the legitimate business interests that the employer may be trying to advance by maintaining its rule.

Over the past nearly 25 years, the Board has attempted to articulate and consistently apply a generally applicable test under Section 8(a)(1) for assessing facial challenges to work rules. For almost half that time, the _Lutheran Heritage_ standard provided the interpretive principles relevant to assessing the impact of a given rule on employees’ rights. We detail the Board’s recent history below with an eye toward explaining why a modified version of the _Lutheran Heritage_ standard is the best approach to evaluating facial challenges to work rules in light of the Board’s experience and long-established statutory principles. Our decision today does not disturb the Board’s long-established doctrines covering work rules that address union (or other protected) solicitation, distribution, or insignia. Consistent with the Board’s decisions in both _Lutheran Heritage_ and _Boeing_, we preserve Board precedent in those areas.

[Lafayette Park]{.casesubsection}

The recent history of the Board’s approach to work rules begins with _Lafayette Park Hotel_ (1998). There, a full Board considered facial challenges to rules defining various types of “unacceptable conduct.” The Board identified “the appropriate inquiry” as “whether the rules would reasonably tend to chill employees in the exercise of their Section 7 rights” and that, where there is a likely chilling effect, “the Board may conclude that their maintenance is an unfair labor practice, even absent evidence of enforcement.” For that standard, the Board referred to the Supreme Court’s decision in _Republic Aviation_, quoting its admonition that assessing the challenged rules involves “working out an adjustment between the undisputed right of self-organization assured to employees under the Act and the equally undisputed right of employers to maintain discipline in their establishments.” Member Hurtgen, disagreeing with the majority, expressed his view that “if a rule reasonably chills the exercise of Sec. 7 rights, it can nonetheless be lawful if it is justified by significant employer interests.”

In analyzing the challenged rules’ impact on employees under its announced standard, the _Lafayette Park_ Board did consider the employer’s interests in maintaining its rules, if not in the manner Member Hurtgen sought. l use of certain of the employer’s facilities, the Board noted the “legitimate business reasons for such a rule” and its view that “employees would recognize the rule for its legitimate purpose.” Similarly, when assessing the employer’s rule forbidding fraternization between employees and customers, the Board noted that employees “would recognize the legitimate business reasons for which such a rule was promulgated, and would not reasonably believe that it reaches Section 7 activity.” Although the Board considered the employer’s interests (as effectively communicated to employees), it did so in the course of interpreting a rule and assessing its potential chilling effect on employees.

The _Lafayette Park_ Board was divided, too, in how to correctly apply the announced standard to particular rules. In a partial dissent, Members Fox and Liebman thought the majority merely paid “lip service” to the applicable interpretive principles in upholding rules that, in their view, had “the likely effect of chilling Section 7 activity.” In response, Chairman Gould characterized their dissenting approach as one that improperly “parsed out certain words and createed theoretical definitions” for rules “that differ from the obvious ones.” He asserted that the Board should not “focus on whether any language in the rules could theoretically encompass Section 7 activity” but, instead, should focus on “whether a reasonable employee could believe that the rule prohibits protected activity.” 

[Lutheran Heritage]{.casesubsection}

A few years later, in another full-Board decision, _Lutheran Heritage_ (2004), the majority construed Lafayette Park to mean that the relevant inquiry “begins with the issue of whether the rule explicitly restricts activities protected by Section 7.” If it does not, a violation “is dependent upon a showing of one of the following: (1) employees would reasonably construe the language to prohibit Section 7 activity; (2) the rule was promulgated in response to union activity; or (3) the rule has been applied to restrict the exercise of Section 7 rights.” Under the first of these prongs, the majority instructed that the Board “must refrain from reading particular phrases in isolation,” “must not presume” that a rule will cause “improper interference with employee rights,” and should not conclude “that a reasonable employee would read a rule to apply to Section 7 activity simply because the rule could be interpreted that way.” 

In an effort to refine the standard applied in _Lafayette Park_, the Board in _Lutheran Heritage_ observed that it was not enough to establish a violation of Section 8(a)(1) merely because a rule “could conceivably be read to cover Section 7 activity,” but in referring to how a reasonable employee ““would read” the rule, the majority did not expressly hold that the coercive meaning must be the only reasonable interpretation of the rule or the most reasonable interpretation. The _Lutheran Heritage_ Board acknowledged that the rules it was scrutinizing “serve legitimate business purposes” and that reasonable employees “would realize the lawful purpose of the challenged rules”--thereby suggesting that such considerations had informed its conclusions--but again the _Lutheran Heritage_ majority did not clearly explain how employer interests factored into the analysis. Finally, _Lutheran Heritage_ rejected a categorical approach to work rules. The majority acknowledged the case-by-case nature of the Board’s work rules decisions, noting that it did “not consider it necessary or appropriate to decide in this case what rules in a future hypothetical case would be unlawful.”

In dissent, Members Liebman and Walsh raised the issue of balancing. They argued that in Lafayette Park the Board had recognized that “determining the lawfulness of an employer’s work rules requires balancing competing interests,” and they accused the majority of “ignoring the employees’ side of the balance.” The dissenters agreed that employers have legitimate business interests that warrant protection through the maintenance of work rules but contended that the employer must do so “subject to the requirement that employers articulate those rules with sufficient specificity that they do not impinge on employees’ free exercise of Section 7 rights.”

_Lutheran Heritage_, then, again demonstrated the Board’s ongoing efforts to develop a standard that grappled with the two key questions posed in work rules cases: (1) how to interpret a rule and (2) whether and how employer interests factor into the analysis.

[Aftermath of Lutheran Heritage]{.casesubsection}

Following _Lutheran Heritage_, the Board decided many work rules cases, and reviewing courts consistently applied and upheld the standard.8 However, there was some degree of confusion and disagreement about some aspects of its proper application, in particular whether, and if so, how, to consider an employer’s reasons for maintaining a challenged rule.

For instance, in _Flagstaff Medical Center_ (2011), a panel majority found a hospital employer’s rule restricting employees’ use of cameras lawful, in part because of the employer’s “significant interest” in having the rule to prevent the disclosure of patient health information. The majority there viewed the employer’s interest in maintaining the rule relevant to the analysis insofar as it informed the majority’s assessment that reasonable employees would recognize that employer interest and view the rule “as a legitimate means of protecting the privacy of patients and their hospital surroundings, not as a prohibition of protected activity.” 

But in a separate decision issued on the same day, a different panel majority assessed an employer’s maintenance of certain work rules and made no mention of the employer’s interests. Instead, the majority determined that the “only question” relevant was whether the employees “would reasonably construe the . . . rules to prohibit Section 7 activity” and did not mention the employer’s interests for maintaining the rules as part of its analysis resolving that question. Courts occasionally regarded the Board’s implicit approach to addressing employer interests under _Lutheran Heritage_ as placing a rebuttal burden on the employer, once it was established that a rule had a reasonable tendency to chill employees’ exercise of Section 7 rights.9

[William Beaumont]{.casesubsection}

In _William Beaumont Hospital_ (2016), a majority consisting of then-Member McFerran and Member Hirozawa struck down a hospital employer’s rule prohibiting conduct that “impedes harmonious interactions and relationships” because employees would reasonably understand that it could encompass interactions protected by Section 7. The majority also found a rule prohibiting “negative or disparaging comments” unlawful because it would reasonably be construed to prohibit protected expressions of concern about working conditions. 

In dissent, Member Miscimarra contended that the _Lutheran Heritage_ standard foreclosed consideration of employers’ justifications for their rules. In his view, the “‘reasonably construe’ standard entailed a single-minded consideration of NLRA-protected rights, without taking into account the legitimate justifications of particular policies, rules and handbook provisions.” He advocated a revised approach whereby, in every case challenging an employer’s maintenance of a work rule, the Board would determine “the potential adverse impact of the rule on NLRA-protected activity” and “the legitimate justifications an employer may have for maintaining the rule.” Once the competing interests were identified, the Board should then balance them such that “a facially neutral rule should be declared unlawful only if the justifications are outweighed by the adverse impact on Section 7 activity.” 

In response, the _William Beaumont_ majority acknowledged that assessing work rules was a “difficult area of labor law,” particularly because of “the remarkable number, variety, and detail of employer work rules.” But the majority also noted that, in the years since the Board had decided _Lutheran Heritage_, no court of appeals had rejected the standard that the Board regularly applied in work-rules cases. The majority further explained that the _Lutheran Heritage_ standard did, in fact, “take into account employer interests.” It did so by leaving employers free to protect their legitimate business interests by adopting more narrowly tailored rules while not infringing on Section 7 rights. The majority noted that when the Board found that a rule was not unlawfully overbroad, “it was typically because the rule was tailored such that the employer’s legitimate business interest in maintaining the rule was sufficiently apparent to a reasonable employee.” 

[Boeing and LA Specialty Produce]{.casesubsection}

Less than 2 years later, without being asked and without seeking any public input, a newly constituted Board effectively incorporated the William Beaumont dissent into the majority opinion in _Boeing Co._ (2017). The _Boeing_ majority held that, when deciding the lawfulness of maintaining a ““facially neutral” work rule, the Board “will evaluate two things: (i) the nature and extent of the potential impact on NLRA rights, and (ii) legitimate justifications associated with the rule.” Those two factors would be balanced against each other. According to the majority, the _Lutheran Heritage_ standard did not permit the Board to consider an employer’s legitimate business reasons for maintaining a rule; to distinguish between more and less important Section 7 interests; to differentiate among industries, work settings, or specific circumstances reflected in a given rule; or to produce consistent rulings in work-rules cases. And the majority claimed that past Board decisions specifying criteria for assessing the lawfulness of specific types of rules--like rules concerning workplace solicitation and distribution of literature--comport with its standard, which permitted accommodating employer interests, but not under _Lutheran Heritage_, which it asserted did not.

The majority also created a categorical classification system for evaluating rules under its standard. In “Category 1”--rules that were always lawful to maintain--it would put rules that, as a type, did not interfere with Section 7 rights and rules where the adverse impacts on Section 7 rights were outweighed by justifications associated with such rules. In “Category 2”--rules that were sometimes lawful to maintain--it would put rules that “warrant scrutiny in each case.” And in “Category 3”--rules that were always unlawful to maintain--it would put rules that, given their impact on protected activity, could never be justified by an employer. The purported intent of this categorical approach was to “provide far greater clarity and certainty” for regulated parties. 

Applying its new standard, the _Boeing_ majority upheld a rule maintained by the employer, a manufacturer of military and commercial aircraft, restricting the use of cameras in the workplace because any “adverse impact” on Section 7 rights was “comparatively slight” and was “outweighed by substantial and important justifications associated with _Boeing_’s maintenance of the no-camera rule.” Without further explanation, it deemed all rules of that type always lawful for employers to maintain no matter the circumstances. Remarkably, the _Boeing_ Board also designated all rules “requiring employees to abide by basic standards of civility”--of the sort at issue in _William Beaumont_, but not at issue in _Boeing_--as always lawful. 

Then-Member McFerran and Member Pearce both dissented, expressing similar views. Member McFerran asserted that, as the Board had recently explained in _William Beaumont_, the standard under _Lutheran Heritage_ did allow for consideration of an employer’s legitimate business justifications for its work rules. But Member McFerran contended that the majority’s approach here went too far, privileging an employer’s interests over the rights of employees, who, because of their economic dependence on employers, reasonably take a cautious approach when interpreting work rules for fear of running afoul of a rule whose scope is unclear. Member McFerran also criticized the majority’s assertion that its approach would provide more “certainty and clarity,” as she noted that it failed to identify which Section 7 rights and which employer interests are entitled to more or less weight in its balancing. 

As to the majority’s categorical approach, Member McFerran noted that designating a type of rule as always lawful to maintain improperly forgoes particularized scrutiny of a similar rule in an altogether different workplace by finding it lawful without addressing what particular Section 7 rights are at stake, what justifications an employer might actually offer for its rule, and what industry or work setting is involved. 

Member Pearce expressed similar criticisms. He found “particularly troubling” the majority’s designation of civility rules as always lawful to maintain. He pointed out that no civility rules were at issue in the case and that, in any event, civility rules threatened to chill the sort of heated expression that was not uncommon when employees engage in Section 7 activity. 

Less than 2 years later, in _LA Specialty Produce Co._ (2019), a Board majority observed that _Boeing_ needed to be buttressed with some “points of clarification.” One ostensible clarification addressed how rules should be interpreted. The majority asserted that the reasonable employee does “not view every employer policy through the prism of the NLRA,” such that “a challenged rule may not be found unlawful merely because it could be interpreted, under some hypothetical scenario, as potentially limiting some type of Section 7 activity.” A second ostensible clarification addressed the burden of proof to demonstrate a work rule’s impact on Section 7 rights, holding that “it is the General Counsel’s initial burden in all cases to prove that a facially neutral rule would in context be interpreted by a reasonable employee . . . to potentially interfere with the exercise of Section 7 rights.” The majority also attempted to clarify the categorical approach by explaining that a rule should be placed in Category 1, and thus deemed always lawful to maintain, when the “general” employer interests in maintaining such a rule outweigh the potential impact on the exercise of Section 7 rights. 

Member McFerran dissented. As a threshold matter, she summarized what she deemed to be the primary defects in the reasoning of the _Boeing_ Board. Those included (1) that the Board, in rejecting _Lutheran Heritage_ and announcing a new standard, did so sua sponte and without public input; (2) that the standard under _Lutheran Heritage_ already permitted the Board to consider an employer’s legitimate business justifications for its work rules; (3) that the _Boeing_ standard fails to properly assess rules from the perspective of a reasonable employee because it does not consider the economic dependence of employees on employers, which increases the chilling potential of ambiguous rules; and (4) that _Boeing_’s categorical approach dispenses with individualized scrutiny for rules by ignoring their wording, whether they were narrowly tailored, and their context. 

Member McFerran also disagreed with the clarifications that _LA Specialty Produce_ purported to make to _Boeing_. Specifically, she argued that the majority’s description of a reasonable employee ignored employees’ economic dependence on the employer and the resulting reasonable tendency to interpret work rules as coercive, even where a disinterested person would not. She also faulted the majority’s requirement that the General Counsel must prove that a work rule “would in context be interpreted . . . to potentially interfere with the exercise of Section 7 rights” as effectively (but not explicitly) requiring a showing that the coercive interpretation of a rule is the only reasonable interpretation. As for the balancing test, Member McFerran noted that the majority failed to explain which party has the burden of proof with respect to the balancing, and that its endorsement of a “general” balancing approach eliminated consideration of the language of a particular rule or the requirement of narrow tailoring. 

[Aftermath of Boeing and LA Specialty Produce]{.casesubsection}

Since _Boeing_ was decided, both before and after the Board’s attempted clarification of it in _LA Specialty Produce_, the Board has applied its new standard in a number of cases. The Board has usually found work rules lawful to maintain and, generally, has categorically deemed all similar rules to be lawful to maintain, no matter the specific wording of any particular rule or the specific workplace context in which they are maintained.

[II.]{.casesection}

Having considered the valuable perspectives of the parties and amici, as well as the Board’s past experience and the views of our dissenting colleague, we have decided the better approach is a modified version of the framework set forth in _Lutheran Heritage_ for evaluating facial challenges to employer work rules that do not explicitly restrict Section 7 activity by employees and were not promulgated in response to such activity, as clarified herein. As explained, the key issues presented are: (1) defining the interpretive principles to apply to discern when work rules have a reasonable tendency to chill employees’ exercise of their statutory rights and (2) working out the proper adjustment between protecting employee rights and accommodating employers’ legitimate and substantial business interests in maintaining their rules. Although Lafayette Park and _Lutheran Heritage_ established the Board’s proper interpretive focus--the perspective of a reasonable employee subject to the rule--they did not sufficiently (or clearly) articulate how employers’ interests fit into the analysis. While _Boeing_ and _LA Specialty Produce_, in turn, appropriately recognized that employer interests should factor into the Board’s analysis, they adopted interpretive principles that failed to reflect the true coercive potential of work rules. In addition, those decisions gave too little weight to employees’ Section 7 rights and too much weight to employer interests, in particular by failing to require employers to narrowly tailor their work rules to minimize as much as reasonably possible, if not altogether eliminate, any infringement of employee rights.

The approach we adopt today seeks to preserve the insights of the Board’s prior decisions while addressing their shortcomings. Given the wide range of work rules, the varying language they use, and the many different employment contexts in which they arise, we do not expect our new standard to provide complete certainty and predictability in this area of the law. That abstract goal--as the Board’s experience under _Boeing_ suggests--could be achieved only by arbitrarily expanding the universe of work rules deemed always lawful to maintain, at the obvious expense to employees’ ability to exercise the rights guaranteed to them by the Act.

Our approach is focused on furthering what the Supreme Court many decades ago defined as the “dominant purpose” of the Act: protecting “the right of employees to organize for mutual aid without employer interference.” In the context of this case, achieving the Act’s purpose means ensuring that the Board does not condone employer work rules that chill employees’ exercise of their statutory rights for fear of discipline or discharge if they violate them. The potential for intimidation is great precisely because of what the Supreme Court has described as “the economic dependence of the employees on their employers, and the necessary tendency of the former, because of that relationship, to pick up intended implications of the latter that might be more readily dismissed by a more disinterested ear.” This fact of workplace life should be reflected in the Board’s treatment of work rules under Section 8(a)(1) of the Act, just as the Supreme Court has required with respect to the analysis of employers’ arguably coercive statements to employees.

But “equally undisputed,” as the Supreme Court has also observed, is the “right of employers to maintain discipline in their establishments” and otherwise protect their legitimate and substantial business interests by regulating employees’ workplace conduct. Accordingly, in the work-rules context, as in other situations governed by Section 8(a)(1) of the Act, the Board must fulfill its duty to protect employees’ Section 7 rights while also considering employers’ legitimate and substantial business interests. As we will explain, our new standard gives employers the necessary leeway to maintain rules of their own choosing to advance legitimate and substantial business interests. They simply need to narrowly tailor those rules to significantly minimize, if not altogether eliminate, their coercive potential. If employers do so, their rules will be lawful to maintain.

[A.]{.casesubsection}

It has long been established that the test for evaluating whether an employer’s conduct or statements violate Section 8(a)(1) of the Act is whether they have a reasonable tendency to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees who may engage in activities protected by Section 7. The General Counsel, of course, has the burden of establishing a violation of the Act. As we now explain, our initial focus in the work-rules context is on whether the General Counsel has proven that a rule has a reasonable tendency to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees who contemplate engaging in protected activity. To discern that tendency, the Board--as in all other Section 8(a)(1) contexts--appropriately “views employer statements ‘from the standpoint of employees over whom the employer has a measure of economic power.”’ 

Interpreting a work rule from the perspective of the economically dependent employee who contemplates engaging in Section 7 activity is consistent with workplace reality--employees ordinarily do not wish to risk their jobs by violating their employers’ rules--and with the employee-protective purposes of the Act. As suggested, this frame of reference is entirely consistent with, and arguably compelled by, the Supreme Court’s decision in _Gissel_, which considered whether certain statements made by an employer to his employees violated Section 8(a)(1). Addressing the employer’s argument that its statements were protected by Section 8(c) of the Act, the _Gissel_ Court explained that “an employer’s rights cannot outweigh the equal rights of the employees to associate freely, as those rights are embodied in § 7 and protected by § 8(a)(1).” The Court reasoned that “any balancing of those rights must take into account the economic dependence of the employees on their employers, and the necessary tendency of the former, because of that relationship, to pick up intended implications of the latter that might be more readily dismissed by a more disinterested ear.” These “obvious principles,” in the Court’s words, should be central to our analysis when the Board evaluates a work rule. Accordingly, in interpreting a rule, the Board will take the perspective of the “economically dependent employee” who contemplates engaging in Section 7 activity. Such an employee is readily inclined to avoid violating a rule, and so readily inclined to interpret it more broadly to restrict or prohibit Section 7 activity than a disinterested observer might. Being discharged might mean--to take just two very real examples--being unable to pay rent or put food on the table. For purposes of the Act, then, the coercive potential of a work rule is inextricably intertwined with the vulnerable position of employees.

By explicitly incorporating the perspective of the economically dependent employee into our analysis, we adopt an important interpretive principle that sometimes explicitly factored into the Board’s analysis under Lafayette Park and _Lutheran Heritage_. This principle is consistent with the Board’s long-established practice of construing any ambiguity in a work rule against the employer as the drafter of the rule.

Despite stating that work rules should be interpreted from “the employees’ perspective,” the _Boeing_ Board did not base this perspective on employees’ economic dependence. And, in turn, the Board in _LA Specialty Produce_ obfuscated the issue by asserting--in response to the dissent’s view that rules should be assessed from the perspective of an economically dependent employee--that “a reasonable employee does not presume a Section 7 violation lurks around every corner.” Such rhetoric obscures the need to promote the policies of the Act, consistent with the Supreme Court’s insight in Gissel about employees’ economic position. For statutory purposes, the relevant reasonable employee is the employee who contemplates engaging in Section 7 activity, because this is the activity that the Act is explicitly intended to protect from employer interference. Whether some hypothetical employee only sometimes, or even never, contemplates Section 7 activity is immaterial. Indeed, if the likelihood of an employee contemplating Section 7 activity were somehow a relevant consideration, then even a rule explicitly prohibiting such activity could arguably be lawful (as not having a reasonable tendency, in fact, to interfere with the Section 7 activity of an employee who would not contemplate engaging in such activity). It is appropriate, then, for the Board to interpret an ambiguous work rule from the perspective of an employee who contemplates Section 7 activity, but who wishes to avoid the risk of being disciplined or discharged for violating the rule. The Board’s goal, of course, is to ensure that employers do not maintain unlawfully overbroad work rules that have a reasonable tendency to chill employees from exercising their statutory rights.

In interpreting rules from the perspective of a reasonable employee, we believe the Board must also recognize that a typical employee interprets work rules as a layperson rather than as a lawyer. This uncontroversial principle has long been recognized by the Board, which has sensibly observed that “employees do not generally carry lawbooks to work or apply legal analysis to company rules as do lawyers, and cannot be expected to have the expertise to examine company rules from a legal standpoint.” 

In sum, going forward, the Board will begin its analysis by assessing whether the General Counsel has established that a challenged work rule has a reasonable tendency to chill employees from exercising their Section 7 rights. In doing so, the Board will interpret the rule from the perspective of the reasonable employee who is economically dependent on her employer and thus inclined to interpret an ambiguous rule to prohibit protected activity she would otherwise engage in. The reasonable employee interprets rules as a layperson, not as a lawyer. If an employee could reasonably interpret a rule to restrict or prohibit Section 7 activity, the General Counsel has satisfied her burden and demonstrated that the rule is presumptively unlawful. That is so even if the rule could also reasonably be interpreted not to restrict Section 7 rights and even if the employer did not intend for its rule to restrict Section 7 rights.

[B.]{.casesubsection}

For reasons already explained, in some circumstances a violation of Section 8(a)(1) may require more than a showing that an employee could reasonably interpret a work rule to restrict or prohibit Section 7 activity. In such cases, the Board must still evaluate the lawfulness of a work rule in the context of the legitimate and substantial business interests of the employer in maintaining a specific work rule under the particular circumstances. Accordingly, if the General Counsel carries her burden of demonstrating that a rule is presumptively unlawful, an employer may rebut the presumption by proving that the rule advances a legitimate and substantial business interest and that the employer is unable to advance that interest with a more narrowly tailored rule.

As we have explained, prior to _Boeing_, it was unclear precisely how the Board’s work-rules standard incorporated an assessment of employer interests. Our new standard makes explicit that the Board will consider employer interests when evaluating the employer’s rebuttal to the General Counsel’s showing that a rule is presumptively unlawful.

The clarified standard improves on the conspicuous shortcomings of the approach adopted in _Boeing_. Under the _Boeing_ standard, a challenged rule’s “potential impact on NLRA rights” was balanced against “legitimate justifications associated with” the rule. But in practice, the _Boeing_ balancing test was heavily weighted against employees’ Section 7 rights and in favor of employer interests, because--with little if any explanation--the Board proceeded to treat employee rights as “peripheral.” Although the Board under _Boeing_ never explained which employee rights are “peripheral”--and there is no clear support in the Act for making such a determination--the characterization allowed the Board to regularly (and, in our view, arbitrarily) diminish the deleterious impacts of a challenged rule on Section 7 rights.

Crucially, _Boeing_’s balancing approach measured employer interests against employee interests without any requirement that a rule be narrowly tailored to serve the employer’s legitimate interests in having the rule. Under _Boeing_, then, overbroad work rules are perfectly permissible. So long as the employer interests advanced by the rule are found to outweigh the burden on employees’ rights, that rule is lawful to maintain--even if the employer interests could still be advanced by more narrowly crafting the rule such that it lessened or eliminated its burden on employees’ rights. We believe that requiring employers to narrowly tailor their rules is a critical part of working out the proper adjustment between employee rights and employer interests in the work-rules context.

Such a requirement acknowledges employers’ prerogative to craft rules that they need to advance legitimate and substantial business interests while necessarily minimizing or eliminating the burden that such rules can have on employees’ exercise of their statutory rights. We impose no unreasonable burden on employers by expecting them to be aware of their employees’ rights under the National Labor Relations Act, a statute enacted in 1935, more than 85 years ago, and long understood to apply in most workplaces, unionized and nonunionized alike--and to craft rules that minimize interference with their employees’ exercise of these long-established federal rights. Indeed, as we have noted, it has long been uncontroversial that any ambiguity in a work rule must be construed against the employer as the drafter of the rule.

Prior to _Boeing_, the Board often applied a narrow-tailoring requirement. As the Board explained then, many of the Board’s pre-_Boeing_ findings that a given rule was lawful to maintain were “typically because” the rule was narrowly tailored. The courts of appeals approved of the Board’s application of a narrow-tailoring requirement. After all, courts are well familiar with the concepts of facial overbreadth and the importance of narrowly tailoring a rule from the First Amendment context. 

We believe that a narrow-tailoring requirement is exactly the sort of reasonable “adjustment between the undisputed right of self-organization assured to employees under the Act and the equally undisputed right of employers to maintain discipline in their establishments” that the Supreme Court has instructed us to make in comparable situations. 

Under _Boeing_, even after attempting to provide clarifications in _LA Specialty Produce_, the Board never explained which party has the burden of proof with respect to the balancing test. We make clear here that, when a rule is presumptively unlawful, it is the employer’s burden to prove that its legitimate and substantial business interests cannot be accomplished with a more narrowly tailored rule and that, as a result, the rule should be deemed lawful to maintain. Placing the burden on the employer is consistent with the Supreme Court’s decisions in comparable circumstances. This burden allocation is no different than under our more generally applicable Section 8(a)(1) framework. See, e.g., _ANG Newspapers_, 343 NLRB 564, 565 (2004) (“Under the 8(a)(1) standard, the Board first examines whether the employer’s conduct reasonably tended to interfere with Section 7 rights. If so, the burden is on the employer to demonstrate a legitimate and substantial business justification for its conduct.”). This approach also does not change the General Counsel’s burden of proving the unfair labor practice, but rather extends to the employer something akin to an affirmative defense that it has the burden of sustaining to overcome the presumption that a given work rule is unlawful.And allocating this burden to the employer is sensible given that the employer is in the best position to explain its legitimate and substantial business interest, how its rule advances that interest, and why a more narrowly tailored rule would fail to advance that interest.

Having rescinded the standard adopted in _Boeing_ and revised in _LA Specialty Produce_, we necessarily reject those decisions and their progeny, including the categorical holding that the Board has made to find certain types of work rules always lawful to maintain. Instead of that rigid--indeed, arbitrary--categorical approach, we return to a case-by-case approach, which examines the specific language of particular rules and the employer interests actually invoked to justify them.

The primary problem with _Boeing_’s categorical approach is that it was regularly applied to designate all rules of a generalized type as always lawful to maintain, no matter their specific wording, the specific industry or workplace in which the employer maintained the rule, the specific employer interests that the rule was supposed to advance, or any number of context-specific factors that may have arisen in a particular case. _Boeing_ itself exemplifies the arbitrary nature of this categorical approach.

In _Boeing_, the employer was “one of the country’s most prominent defense contractors.” It maintained a rule that, absent a manager-approved business need and a permit issued by its security department, prohibited employees’ use of the camera features of electronic devices (like smartphones) on all company property. Although the Board in _Boeing_ cursorily labeled the adverse impact of this ““no camera” rule on employees’ exercise of Section 7 rights “comparatively slight” (ignoring the importance of photo or video documentation of unfair labor practices, protected concerted activity, and the like), it at least acknowledged that the rule infringed on employees’ exercise of their rights. Yet in applying its balancing test, the _Boeing_ Board found that the employer’s interests advanced by the rule outweighed the adverse impact on employee rights and so deemed the rule lawful to maintain. 

The employer interests advanced by the rule included: serving as an integral component of _Boeing_’s security protocols, “which were necessary to maintain _Boeing_’s accreditation as a federal contractor to perform classified work for the United States Government”; furnishing “a fail-safe to ensure that classified information will not be released outside of _Boeing_ in the event that such information finds its way into a non-classified area”; playing “a key role in ensuring that _Boeing Co._ complies with its federally mandated duty to prevent the disclosure of export-controlled information,” including “‘sensitive equipment, software and technology,’ the export of which is controlled by the federal government ‘as a means to promote our national security and foreign policy objectives'”; mitigating “documented” instances of “foreign powers” trying to steal _Boeing_’s proprietary technology; and limiting “the risk”--in light of _Boeing_’s “documented evidence” of “surveillance by potentially hostile actors”--“of _Boeing_ becoming a target of terrorist attack.” 

All of these interests that pertained to _Boeing_ are obviously unique to “one of the country’s most prominent defense contractors.” They have no relevance to the overwhelming majority of employers who do not deal in “classified” information, “export-controlled information,” and the like. Despite that fact, and remarkably without any further justification, the _Boeing_ Board put “no camera” and “no recording” rules “into Category 1,” meaning that all rules of that type are always lawful for every employer to maintain. In other words, every employer can lawfully maintain a “no camera” or “no recording” rule that the _Boeing_ Board admitted chills the exercise of Section 7 rights even if--as will be true for the overwhelming majority of them--those employers share none of the interests that justified _Boeing_’s maintenance of its rule. _Boeing_ thus reflects an arbitrary and capricious approach to the analysis of work rules. We reject it.

In _LA Specialty Produce_, in turn, the Board purported to offer “points of clarification” for the categorical approach. The primary point of purported clarification was to state that _Boeing_’s “Category 1” balancing test involves measuring “general” employer interests advanced by a rule against the rule’s interference with employees’ exercise of Section 7 rights. While there may be some legitimate interests common to all employers at all times, and that are always entitled to the same weight in a balancing analysis, it is easy to see how such a broad approach can lead to giving employer interests in a particular case too much weight with too little justification, unnecessarily sacrificing Section 7 rights in the process. In endorsing “general” employer interests, _LA Specialty Produce_ clearly did not effectively limit _Boeing_’s most obvious analytical flaw by leaving undisturbed _Boeing_’s holding that all “no camera” and “no recording” rules are always lawful. Confirmation of that fact is apparent in the Board’s post-_LA Specialty Produce_ decisions. For instance, in _AT&T Mobility, LLC_, the Board found a cellphone retail employer’s rule that prohibited employees from recording conversations lawful to maintain “as a matter of law” simply because it was a “no recording” rule and thus categorically lawful to maintain. It did not matter that a cellphone retailer does not deal with classified information, export controls, documented threats of foreign interference, and the like, despite that those were the very interests that justified the categorical lawfulness of the “no camera” rule in _Boeing_. We believe that a return to “case-specific justification” better serves the purposes of the Act.

_Boeing_’s categorical approach is also hamstrung by its elimination of any consideration of the specific language or context of particular rules. Under _Boeing_, this was done by, in a single case, analyzing whether one particular rule--including its specific wording and context--chills employees’ exercise of Section 7 rights, concluding that it does not, and then broadly declaring lawful all similar rules of that general type, regardless of the specific language or context of any of those purportedly similar rules.

Our return to a case-specific approach is intended to remedy the obvious problems with _Boeing_’s categorical approach. In order to consider all important aspects of the problem posed by potentially overbroad work rules, the Board should examine the specific wording of the rule, the specific industry and workplace context in which it is maintained, the specific employer interests it may advance, and the specific statutory rights it may infringe. The case-by-case approach will not sacrifice clarity and predictability for regulated parties. As is always the norm, the Board will aim to ensure that like cases will be decided alike. The nearer the wording of a specific rule is to a rule assessed in a prior case, or the nearer the workplace context or employer interests are to those factors previously considered, the more likely the Board’s determination of the rule’s legality will be the same. As a consequence, more predictable outcomes will emerge over time. For instance, many of the Board’s core pre-_Lafayette Park_ work-rules holdings--such as those concerning maintenance of a “no solicitation” rule--that _Boeing_ did not overrule and that we maintain, describe generally applicable parameters for assessing certain types of rules. But that process should not be short-circuited, as the Board plainly did in applying _Boeing_. Put somewhat differently, consistent with the Act, predictability and certainty cannot be achieved simply by giving employers broad authority to adopt work rules and by correspondingly shrinking the scope of Section 7.

[III.]{.casesection}

In this case, the General Counsel alleges that the Respondent unlawfully maintained overbroad work rules governing personal conduct, conflicts of interest, and confidentiality of harassment complaints. Applying _Boeing_ and its progeny, the judge determined that maintenance of those rules was unlawful. Having overruled those decisions, we do not review the judge’s application of them. Instead, to allow the parties an opportunity to present arguments and introduce any relevant evidence under the new standard announced today, we remand this case to the judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
