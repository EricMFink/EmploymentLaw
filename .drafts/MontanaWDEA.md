::: {.legalcode}

#### 39-2-901. Short title. 

This part may be cited as the "Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act". 

#### 39-2-902. Purpose. 

This part sets forth certain rights and remedies with respect to wrongful discharge. Except as provided in 39-2-912, this part provides the exclusive remedy for a wrongful discharge from employment. 

#### 39-2-903. Definitions. In this part, the following definitions apply:

(1\) "Constructive discharge" means the voluntary termination of employment by an employee because of a situation created by an act or omission of the employer which an objective, reasonable person would find so intolerable that voluntary termination is the only reasonable alternative. Constructive discharge does not mean voluntary termination because of an employer's refusal to promote the employee or improve wages, responsibilities, or other terms and conditions of employment.

(2\) "Discharge" includes a constructive discharge as defined in subsection (1\) and any other termination of employment, including resignation, elimination of the job, layoff for lack of work, failure to recall or rehire, and any other cutback in the number of employees for a legitimate business reason.

(3\) "Employee" means a person who works for another for hire. The term does not include a person who is an independent contractor.

(4\) "Fringe benefits" means the value of any employer-paid vacation leave, sick leave, medical insurance plan, disability insurance plan, life insurance plan, and pension benefit plan in force on the date of the termination.

(5\) "Good cause" means any reasonable job-related grounds for an employee's dismissal based on:

- (a\) the employee's failure to satisfactorily perform job duties;
- (b\) the employee's disruption of the employer's operation;
- (c\) the employee's material or repeated violation of an express provision of - the employer's written policies; or
- (d\) other legitimate business reasons determined by the employer while exercising the employer's reasonable business judgment. The legal use of a lawful product by an individual off the employer's premises during nonworking hours is not a legitimate business reason, unless the employer acts within the provisions of [39-2-313](https://archive.legmt.gov/bills/mca/title_0390/chapter_0020/part_0090/section_0030/0390-0020-0090-0030.html../../part_0030/section_0130/0390-0020-0030-0130.html\)(3\) or (4\).

(6\) "Leave of absence" means an employee's absence from work for a period of more than 5 consecutive working days for any reason other than holidays and vacations.

(7\) "Lost wages" means the gross amount of wages that would have been reported to the internal revenue service as gross income on form W-2 and includes additional compensation deferred at the option of the employee.

(8\) "Public policy" means a policy in effect at the time of the discharge concerning the public health, safety, or welfare established by constitutional provision, statute, or administrative rule.


#### 39-2-904. Elements of wrongful discharge. 

(1\) A discharge is wrongful only if:

- (a\) it was in retaliation for the employee's refusal to violate public policy or for reporting a violation of public policy;
- (b\) the discharge was not for good cause and the employee had completed the employer's probationary period of employment;
- (c\) the employer materially violated an express provision of its own written personnel policy prior to the discharge, and the violation deprived the employee of a fair and reasonable opportunity to remain in a position of employment with the employer; or
- (d\) the employer terminated the employee solely based on the employee's legal expression of free speech, including but not limited to statements made on social media.

(2\) During a probationary period of employment, the employment may be terminated at the will of either the employer or the employee on notice to the other for any reason or for no reason.

(3\) The employer has the broadest discretion when making a decision to discharge any managerial or supervisory employee.


#### 39-2-905. Remedies. 

(1\) If an employer has committed a wrongful discharge, the employee may be awarded lost wages and fringe benefits for a period not to exceed 4 years from the date of discharge, together with interest on the lost wages and fringe benefits. The employee's interim earnings, derived from any new kind, nature, or type of work, hire, contractor status, or employment that did not exist at the time of discharge, including amounts the employee could have earned with reasonable diligence from the work, hire, contractor status, or employment, must be deducted from the amount awarded for lost wages. Before interim earnings are deducted from lost wages, there must be deducted from the interim earnings any reasonable amounts expended by the employee in searching for, obtaining, or relocating to new employment.

(2\) Following any verdict or award in favor of the discharged employee, the district court shall consider any monetary payments, compensation, or benefits the employee received arising from or related to the discharge, including unemployment compensation or benefits and early retirement pay, and shall deduct those payments, compensation, and benefits from the amount awarded for lost wages before entering judgment.

(3\) The employee may recover punitive damages otherwise allowed by law if it is established by clear and convincing evidence that the employer engaged in actual fraud or actual malice in the discharge of the employee in violation of 39-2-904(1\)(a\).

(4\) There is no right under any legal theory to damages for wrongful discharge under this part for pain and suffering, emotional distress, compensatory damages, punitive damages, or any other form of damages, except as provided for in subsections (1\) and (2\).

#### 39-2-910. Probationary period. 

(1\) If an employer does not establish a specific probationary period or provide that there is no probationary period prior to or at the time the employee begins work, there is a probationary period of 12 months commencing on the date the employee begins work.

(2\) An employer may extend a probationary period prior to the expiration of a probationary period, but the original probationary period together with any periods of extension may not exceed 18 months.

(3\) If an employee has one or more leaves of absence during the original probationary period or any extension of the probationary period, the time of each leave of absence may not be a part of the probationary period unless the employer affirmatively elects to include each leave of absence as part of the probationary period.

#### 39-2-911. Limitation of actions. 

(1\) An action under this part must be filed within 1 year after the date of discharge.

(2\) If an employer maintains written internal procedures, other than those specified in 39-2-912, under which an employee may appeal a discharge within the organizational structure of the employer, the employee shall first exhaust those procedures prior to filing an action under this part. The employee's failure to initiate or exhaust available internal procedures is a defense to an action brought under this part. If the employer's internal procedures are not completed within 90 days from the date the employee initiates the internal procedures, the employee may file an action under this part and for purposes of this subsection the employer's internal procedures are considered exhausted. The limitation period in subsection (1\) is tolled until the procedures are exhausted. In no case may the provisions of the employer's internal procedures extend the limitation period in subsection (1\) more than 120 days.

(3\) If the employer maintains written internal procedures under which an employee may appeal a discharge within the organizational structure of the employer, the employer shall within 14 days of the date of the discharge notify the discharged employee in writing or electronically of the existence of the internal procedures. The timeframe for the employee to initiate the procedures, if any, begins to run from the date the employer sends or provides a copy of the internal procedures in writing or electronically. A copy of the procedures must be considered provided to the employee if the employer sends a copy of the procedures to the employee's last-known postal mailing address or electronic mailing address or the employee's attorney. If the employer fails to comply with this subsection, the discharged employee need not comply with subsection (2\).

(4\) If a plaintiff commences a civil action for wrongful discharge under this part, the plaintiff shall make service of process no later than 6 months after filing the complaint. If the plaintiff fails to make service of process within the 6-month period, the court, on motion or on its own initiative, shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to a defendant unless that defendant has made an appearance in the civil action. If the plaintiff fails to make service of process within the 6-month period, the remaining 1-year period of limitations for a civil action under this part resumes regardless of whether the civil action is dismissed.

#### 39-2-912. Exemptions. 

(1\) This part does not apply to a discharge:

- (a\) that is subject to any other state or federal statute that provides a procedure or remedy for contesting the dispute. The statutes include those that prohibit discharge for filing complaints, charges, or claims with administrative bodies or that prohibit unlawful discrimination based on race, national origin, sex, ... age, disability, creed, religion, political belief, color, marital status, and other similar grounds.
- (b\) of an employee covered by a written collective bargaining agreement or a written contract of employment for a specific term.

(2\) For the purposes of this section, a contract for a specific term may contain a probationary period as provided for in 39-2-910 and may contain an automatic renewal clause that automatically renews the contract of employment for one or more successive terms.

#### 39-2-913. Preemption of common-law remedies. 

Except as provided in this part, no claim for discharge may arise from tort or express or implied contract.

#### 39-2-914. Arbitration. 

(1\) A party may make a written offer to arbitrate a dispute that otherwise could be adjudicated under this part.

(2\) An offer to arbitrate must be in writing and contain the following provisions:

- (a\) A neutral arbitrator must be selected by mutual agreement or, in the absence of agreement, as provided in [27-5-211](https://archive.legmt.gov/bills/mca/title_0390/chapter_0020/part_0090/section_0140/0390-0020-0090-0140.html../../../../title_0270/chapter_0050/part_0020/section_0110/0270-0050-0020-0110.html).
- (b\) The arbitration must be governed by the Uniform Arbitration Act, Title 27, chapter 5. If there is a conflict between the Uniform Arbitration Act and this part, this part applies.
- (c\) The arbitrator is bound by this part.

(3\) If a complaint is filed under this part, the offer to arbitrate must be made within 60 days after service of the complaint and must be accepted in writing within 30 days after the date the offer is made.

(4\) A discharged employee who makes a valid offer to arbitrate that is accepted by the employer and who prevails in such arbitration is entitled to have the arbitrator's fee and all costs of arbitration paid by the employer.

(5\) If a valid offer to arbitrate is made and accepted, arbitration is the exclusive remedy for the wrongful discharge dispute and there is no right to bring or continue a lawsuit under this part. The arbitrator's award is final and binding, subject to review of the arbitrator's decision under the provisions of the Uniform Arbitration Act.

#### 39-2-915. Effect of rejection of offer to arbitrate. 

A party who makes a valid offer to arbitrate that is not accepted by the other party and who prevails in an action under this part is entitled as an element of costs to reasonable attorney fees incurred subsequent to the date of the offer.
