### @GlaxiolaWilliamsSeafoodArapahoe_EDNC2011

This matter is before the court on plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment, defendants' motion for partial summary judgment, and plaintiff Silvia Rubio Gaxiola's ("Gaxiola") motion for class certification of the claims brought pursuant to the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 95-25.1 _et seq._ Appropriate responses and replies have been filed, and the time for further filings has expired. These matters are ripe for adjudication.

[Background]{.casesection}

This is an action alleging claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 201 _et seq._ ("FLSA") and the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 95-25.1 _et seq._ ("NCWHA"). Gaxiola is a former employee of defendants who was recruited in Mexico to work as a crab picker at defendants' seafood processing facility in Arapahoe, North Carolina. Gaxiola alleges that she and other individuals employed by defendants on H-2B guestworker visas from 2005 through 2008 were not paid minimum wage for all hours worked in violation of the FLSA. Specifically, Gaxiola alleges: (1) that she and other employees were paid on a piece-rate basis (by weight of crab picked) even when the weekly pay earned through a piece rate was less than the minimum wage mandated by federal law; and (2) that defendants reduced her wages and the wages of her coworkers below minimum wage by deducting from their paychecks costs incurred for the benefit of defendants, such as visa, transportation and border crossing expenses. Additionally, Gaxiola brings a claim pursuant to NCWHA alleging defendants failed to pay plaintiff and members of the proposed NCWHA class at least he promised wage each week in which they performed work for defendants. Gaxiola alleges that defendants also violated NCWHA by making unauthorized deductions from her pay and the pay of the proposed plaintiff class members for transportation, visa and border crossing expenses.

[Statement of the Facts]{.casesection}

Plaintiff class members were employed by defendants pursuant to the H-2B visa program, which allows the temporary employment of foreign workers. The terms of the H-2B visa program are controlled by statute, as well as by United States Department of Labor ("USDOL") regulations applicable to the temporary labor certification process. On December 19, 2008, USDOL published new regulations governing the H-2B program. Both the previous and the new H-2B regulations require the Secretary of Labor to make two overarching determinations before allowing an employer to employ H-2B workers:

> (i\) Whether U.S. workers are available to perform temporary employment in the United States, for which an employer desires to employ nonimmigrant foreign workers, and

> (ii\) whether the employment of aliens for such temporary work will adversely affect the wages or working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.

Employers must pay H-2B workers the highest of the following rates: the prevailing wage as determined by the USDOL, federal minimum wage, the applicable state minimum wage, or the applicable local minimum wage. The prevailing wage is the wage necessary to protect against adversely affecting U.S. workers.

In 2005, 2006 and 2007 defendants sought permission to import foreign labor to work as crab pickers in their seafood processing plant by filing temporary labor certification applications ("Clearance Orders") with USDOL. The Clearance Orders were prepared, signed and submitted by defendant Midyette. On each Clearance Order, defendants indicated the number of workers needed, the period of employment, the type of work, and the terms and conditions of work being offered by defendants. The Clearance Orders indicated that the H-2B workers would work 35 hours per week plus varying overtime; that the regular work schedule would be 7:00 am until 4:00 pm; that job duties would include hand picking meat from the bodies and claws of crabs and placing the meat in a cup; and that the basic rate of pay based on the prevailing wage would be $5.17 per hour in 2005 and 2006, and $6.17 per hour in 2007. USDOL approved the terms of the work in the Clearance Orders and certified defendants to employ foreign workers through the H-2B visa program. 

Once an employer receives temporary labor certification from USDOL, the employer may then petition United States Customs and Immigration Services for the actual visas. Each individual who is going to work pursuant to the certification must go to the United States Consulate in his home country to apply for and receive his visa. H-2B visas issued to workers are valid only for the specific job described in the employer's Clearance Order. Upon completion of the work period described in the Clearance Order or upon separation from work, the worker is required to return to his home country.

During the time period relevant to the instant matter, defendants relied on returning workers and word of mouth to fill job openings each year. Two of defendants' H-2B employees, Alba Gloria Acosta and Amado Segura, along with their daughter, acted on behalf of defendants while in Mexico by communicating with new and returning workers and making arrangements for those workers. Defendant Midyette made visa interview appointments for the workers and then notified them of their appointments. Acosta and Segura made arrangements for the workers to travel together to their visa interviews as well as from their homes in Mexico to Arizona. 

Defendants loaned money to Gaxiola as well as some other H-2B workers to cover some of their travel costs and visa expenses. Additionally, defendants purchased airline tickets for the named plaintiff and all of the other H-2B workers to fly from Arizona to North Carolina.

Defendants recovered the cost of the flights and the money advanced to workers to cover the other H-2B related expenses primarily through payroll deductions. Defendants never received written authorization to make those deductions. 

Defendants did not advance money to all their employees to cover these expenses; some of the workers paid all of these costs except for their airline tickets. These workers were not reimbursed for the visa, border crossing or transportation expenses that they paid themselves. 

[I. Summary Judgment]{.casesection}

Plaintiffs seek an order granting summary judgment as to liability, contending that:

> (1) Defendants willfully violated the minimum wage provisions of FLSA by failing to pay Gaxiola and the FLSA class members the minimum wage established in 29 U.S.C. § 206(a)(1)when compensation on a piece-rate basis resulted in pay less than the minimum wage. Defendants also willfully violated the minimum wage provisions of the FLSA by shifting the transportation, visa, and border crossing expenses, costs which were incurred for the benefit of defendants, to Gaxiola and the other members of the FLSA class when those costs brought their pay below minimum wage.

> (2) Defendants violated the wage provisions of the NCWHA by failing to pay Gaxiola and the proposed NCWHA class members all of their wages when those wages were due under an express, constructive or implied agreement to pay those wages at those rates for all work performed for the defendants. Defendants also violated the NCWHA by deducting from the weekly wages due Gaxiola and the proposed NCWHA class members transportation, visa and border crossing expenses incurred for the benefit of defendants.

Defendants move for summary judgment as to the following claims: (1) willful violations of the FLSA; (2) liquidated damages under the FLSA or NCWHA (asserting "good faith" defense); (3) all claims under the NCWHA to the extent that Gaxiola has not sought certification of a class of plaintiffs who share those claims or who could potentially opt out of such a class; and (4) any claims seeking reimbursement of passport fees, visa fees, or any transportation costs.

[II. FLSA Claims]{.casesection}

[A. Coverage by the FLSA]{.casesubsection}

The FLSA is a remedial statute designed to "eliminate substandard labor conditions" in the United States. It was enacted to protect workers who lack sufficient bargaining power to secure a subsistence wage. Under the FLSA, an employer is required to pay each employee wages at or above the minimum wage rate for the hours worked during each workweek. The FLSA applies to all employees for whom there is not a specific exemption. H-2B workers are not specifically exempt; therefore, they are protected by the provisions of the FLSA.

[B. Failure to Pay Minimum Wage when Piece-Rate Compensation was Less than Minimum Wage]{.casesubsection}

Employers must pay minimum wage for all hours worked. Thus, workers paid on a piece-rate basis are entitled to the minimum wage rate when the piece-rate compensation does not reach the minimum wage. 

Plaintiffs seek summary judgment as to defendants' liability on their claim that workers paid on a piece-rate basis did not receive minimum wage for all hours worked as required by the FLSA. The court agrees that summary judgment is appropriate because there are no contested issues of fact with regard to defendants' liability for failing to pay their employees compensated on a piece-rate basis at least minimum wage during some periods.

Defendants had a production standard in place during the 2005, 2006 and 2007 seasons in which crab pickers were required to pick 3.5 pounds of crab per hour. No one was ever fired for failing to meet the production standard. Yet the evidence shows there were times that defendants paid employees by the pound, even if that pay did not rise to the level of minimum wage. For example, Gaxiola's pay stub from July 11, 2007, shows that she worked 34.4 hours and received gross pay of $164.35. There is a handwritten notation of 86½ on the pay stub, which purportedly is the number of pounds of crab picked by Gaxiola that week. Multiplying that number by the agreed-upon piece-rate of $1.90 per pound equals the $164.35 gross pay received by Gaxiola that week. However, $164.35 for 34.4 hours of work is only $4.78 per hour.

When questioned about defendants' practices, Ms. Midyette admitted that defendants did not always comply with the FLSA's minimum wage requirement. Ms. Midyette stated: "If you're-if you're trying to get me to say that once in awhile they weren't paid their full thing, yes." "If you're-If I-are there incidents where they may not have made production, and got paid by production instead of hours."

Based on the pay stubs presented to the court as well as Midyette's own deposition testimony, the court finds that defendants violated the FLSA at times by failing to pay workers minimum wage when their piece-rate compensation was less than minimum wage. The court therefore grants plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to defendants' liability on this issue. The court makes no findings as to plaintiffs' damages at this time.

[C. Deductions for Visa, Transportation and Border Crossing Fees]{.casesubsection}

Compliance with the FLSA's minimum wage requirements also means that employees are entitled to minimum wage for the number of hours worked during the workweek "free and clear" of improper deductions. 29 C.F.R. §§ 531.35, 776.4. The FLSA defines "wage" to include both cash wages and the reasonable cost of providing "board, lodging, or other facilities;" thus, an employer may count these costs toward satisfying its minimum wage obligations. An employer may not deduct from employee wages the cost of facilities which primarily benefit the employer if such deductions drive wages below the minimum wage.

Additionally, failing to reimburse plaintiffs for their expenditures is equivalent to the employer paying for these expenses and then improperly deducting them from the employees' pay for the first workweek. Known as a _de facto_ deduction, "there is no legal difference between deducting a cost directly from the worker's wages and shifting a cost, which they could not deduct, for the employee to bear." The FLSA was implemented to protect workers and to "eliminate substandard labor conditions throughout the nations." 

In _De Luna-Guerrero,_ this court previously held:

> The employer may count as "wages" under the FLSA the reasonable cost "of furnishing an employee with board, lodging, or other facilities, if such board, lodging, or other facilities are customarily furnished by such employer to his employees." 29 U.S.C. § 203(m). "Other facilities" have been further defined by the regulations contained in 29 CFR § 531.32(a) to include "transportation furnished employees between their homes and work where the travel time does not constitute hours worked compensable under the Act and the transportation is not an incident of and necessary to the employment." However, the regulations also note "that under § 531.3(d)(1), the cost of furnishing 'facilities' which are primarily for the benefit or convenience of the employer will not be recognized as reasonable and may not therefore be included in computing wages." 29 CFR § 531.32(c) (Items held for benefit of employer defined as "transportation charges where such transportation is an incident of and necessary to the employment (as in the case of maintenance-of-way employees of a railroad)").

Therefore, the ultimate question before the court is whether the transportation and visa costs incurred by Gaxiola and the other class members were primarily for the benefit or convenience of the employer and incident of and necessary to the employment. If the costs are determined to have been primarily for the benefit of the employer, the FLSA requires that the plaintiffs be reimbursed for such costs to the extent necessary to ensure that the workers receive minimum wage for each workweek.

[1\. Transportation Costs and Border Crossing Fees]{.casesubsubsection}

The case law in this district is well settled as to transportation costs and border crossing fees. Transportation charges are an inevitable and inseparable consequence of having foreign nationals employed in the United States pursuant to an H-2B visa. These costs are "an incident of and necessary to the employment" and are "primarily for the benefit of the employer." As such, these costs cannot be the subject of a deduction, either actual or de facto, that reduces a worker's wage below federal minimum wage. Therefore, defendants are liable for any deductions taken from plaintiffs' pay, whether actual or de facto, for transportation expenses "to the extent these deductions drove plaintiffs' first week's wages below the statutory minimum." 

[2\. Visa Costs]{.casesubsubsection}

In _De Luna-Guerrero,_ this court found that visa expenses for H-2A employees are "an incident of and necessary to employment" (not "other facilities") as defined by 29 C.F.R. § 531.32(a) and therefore cannot be subject to deduction, either actual or de facto, if such deduction results in a worker receiving less than the minimum wage. Plaintiff asks this court to extend its holding in _De Luna-Guerrero_ to H-2B workers.

The reasons this court found visa expenses to be incident of and necessary to employment of H-2A workers in _De Luna-Guerrero_ apply equally to H-2B visas. The type of visa required for H-2B workers has no value outside of the employment and arises directly out of the employment. Additionally, the visa restricts a worker to one employer for one season, and the visas are integral to the program and are required for employment. 

However, _Frog Island Seafood_ held that the employer was not liable for reimbursement of passport and visa expenses incurred by the plaintiffs in that action. Central to the court's ruling was a 2009 amendment to the H-2B regulations, effective January 18, 2009, which provides that H-2B employers are "not prohibited from receiving reimbursement for costs that are the responsibility of the worker, such as government required passport or visa fees." 20 C.F.R. § 655.22(g)(2) (emphasis added). In _Frog Island,_ the court stated that these DOL regulations "speak directly to the issue of passport and visa expenses" and held for the defendants. Defendants in the instant matter ask the court to follow _Frog Island._

Plaintiffs, however, argue that while the regulation does speak directly to the costs associated with visas and passports, the regulation does not change the relationship between those costs and the FLSA. Plaintiffs argue that the correct interpretation of § 655.22(g)(2) is that employers or their agents are not prohibited from seeking reimbursement for the costs of H-2B visas and/or passports from their employees, as long as the reimbursement does not bring the employees' pay below minimum wage. This court agrees.

Title 20 C.F.R. § 655.22 regulates the obligation of employers under the H-2B labor certification program. It does not speak to compliance with the FLSA. The issue before the court today is not whether defendants have complied with the H-2B regulations, but rather whether there was compliance with the minimum wage requirements of the FLSA. Even the amendment to the H-2B regulation itself cautions that "an employer subject to the FLSA may not make deductions which would violate the FLSA." Additionally, since the court's decision in _Frog Island Seafood,_ the USDOL has reiterated that under the FLSA, transportation and visa costs associated with the H-2B program are primarily for the benefit of the employer. _See_ USDOL Field Assistance Bulletin No. 2009-2 (DE # 39-17) ("This Bulletin clarifies that employers are responsible for paying the transportation and visa expenses of H-2B employees, where shifting these costs to employees would effectively bring their wages below the FLSA minimum wage in their first workweek of employment.")

This court finds no reason to stray from its prior holding in _De Luna-Guerrero._ Under the FLSA, visa expenses are "incident of and necessary to the employment" and therefore do not qualify as "other facilities" and cannot be the subject of deductions, either actual or de facto, that would reduce an employee's wages below the minimum wage.

[D. Willfulness]{.casesubsection}

Defendants move for summary judgment as to plaintiffs' FLSA claims arising prior to August 1, 2006. Defendants contend there is no genuine issue of material fact that any alleged violations were not willful and these claims are therefore barred by the statute of limitations.

The statute of limitations for claims under the FLSA is two years, unless plaintiffs can prove that defendants acted willfully. If willfulness is shown, then the statute of limitations is increased to three years. Plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that defendants' acts or omissions were "willful" within the meaning of the FLSA. An employer's violation of the FLSA is willful if the employer either "knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by" the FLSA. Unreasonable or negligent conduct is not enough to constitute "willful" conduct.

[1\. Piece-rate violations]{.casesubsubsection}

Defendants knew about their obligation to pay the minimum wage to all of their employees. Defendants additionally knew that when they paid their employees on a piece-rate basis they would be required to pay them additional wages if their piece-rate compensation was not at least equal to minimum wage. Plaintiff argues that despite knowledge of their obligations under the FLSA, defendants knowingly and intentionally failed to pay plaintiff and members of the FLSA class who were compensated on a piece-rate basis at least minimum wage on several occasions. This court agrees. In her deposition, defendant Midyette admits that she understood that she was required to pay at least minimum wage for the hours worked, even if she was in the practice of paying on a piece-rate. She also admits that she did not always follow what she knew to be the law. Therefore, as to plaintiffs' claim that defendants violated the FLSA by paying a straight piece-rate wage, this court finds those violations to be willful under the FLSA.

[2\. Deduction Violations]{.casesubsubsection}

Plaintiffs also argue that defendants acted willfully by deducting from their pay, via either actual or de facto deductions, transportation and visa expenses which brought their wages below the required minimum wage. Defendants argue otherwise, asserting that defendant Midyette attended a training session about the H-2B program in 1992 sponsored by the North Carolina Employment Security Commission (not the USDOL). Additionally, they say she did her own research online and by speaking to other crab processors about deduction practices. She did not seek a legal opinion on her practices, but she was never notified by anyone, either worker or government agency, that defendants' practices were unlawful or improper.

This court finds that plaintiffs have not shown evidence sufficient to satisfy their burden of proof on the issue of defendants' willfulness as to the deductions. In making this decision, this court notes the nature of _de facto_ deductions and the fact that the propriety of such deductions has been the subject of ongoing litigation in the federal courts for a number of years. Therefore, the court finds that defendants' "piece-rate violations" were willful, but defendants' deduction violations were not.

[E. Good Faith Defense]{.casesubsection}

The Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. §§ 251 _et seq.,_ includes three employer defenses that may apply even if the employer is found to be in violation of the FLSA: Section 9, which provides a defense based on employer acts or omissions that occurred before the effective date of the Portal-to-Portal Act; Section 10, which provides a bar to liability if the employer can prove good faith as defined therein; and, Section 11, which allows the court, in its discretion, to refuse to award liquidated damages to a prevailing plaintiff under certain circumstances.

Section 10 of the Portal-to-Portal Act, the good-faith defense to the FLSA, provides, in pertinent part, as follows:

> (a\) In any action or proceeding based on any act or omission on or after May 14, 1947, no employer shall be subject to any liability or punishment for or on account of the failure of the employer to pay minimum wages or overtime compensation under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended if he pleads and proves that the act or omission complained of was in good faith in conformity with and in reliance on any written administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval, or interpretation, of the USDOL, or any administrative practice or enforcement policy of USDOL with respect to the class of employers to which he belonged. Such a defense, if established, shall be a bar to the action or proceeding, notwithstanding that after such act or omission, such administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval, interpretation, practice, or enforcement policy is modified or rescinded or is determined by judicial authority to be invalid or of no legal effect.

To avail itself of this defense, an employer must prove that it actually relied upon an administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval, interpretation, enforcement policy or practice. In deciding whether defendants have proven good faith, the court must look at (1) the particular "agency action" upon which the defendants relied; (2) whether defendants can show actual reliance; and, (3) whether defendants acted in good faith, both objectively and subjectively.

Defendants attempt to make an argument, albeit a weak one, that they should be entitled to the good faith defense, relying on basically the same evidence used to argue that their actions were not willful. Merely participating in the H-2B program for several years and assuming you were in compliance because the government never told you otherwise is not sufficient to meet the heavy burden required to take advantage of the good faith defense. Therefore, defendants' motion for summary judgment as to the good faith defense is DENIED.

[III. NCWHA Claims]{.casesection}

[1\. Failure to Obtain Written Authorization for Deductions]{.casesubsubsection}

Under the NCWHA, an employer may withhold a portion of an employee's wages provided that the employer has

> written authorization from the employee which (i) is signed on or before the payday(s) for the pay period(s) from which the deduction is to be made; (ii) indicates the reason for the deduction; and (iii) states the actual dollar amount of wages which shall be deducted from one or more paychecks.

N.C. Gen. Stat. § 95-25.8(a)(2). Defendants have admitted that they did not obtain authorization for the deductions made from their employees' pay. Therefore, as a matter of law, they are liable for violating N.C. Gen. Stat. § 95-25.8.

[2\. Failure to Pay the Promised Wage]{.casesubsubsection}

The NCWHA requires employers to pay their employees at least the promised wage for each hour or part of an hour that they perform labor for their employers. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 95-25.6. In this case, defendants were required to pay each of their H-2B workers the prevailing wage, and they advertised the job openings with the prevailing wage, $6.17 in 2007 and $5.17 in 2006 and 2005, all higher than the federal minimum wage at that time. Defendants have admitted to failing to pay some workers at least the prevailing wage. Additionally, since plaintiffs have shown that defendants violated the FLSA's minimum wage provisions, and the prevailing wage was higher than the FLSA minimum wage, defendants violated N.C. Gen. Stat. § 95-25.6.

[3\. Deductions for Visa, Transportation and Border Crossing Fees]{.casesubsubsection}

efendants have also violated the NCWHA by shifting the cost of visa, transportation and border crossing expenses to Gaxiola and other members of the NCWHA class to the extent those deductions brought their pay below the promised wage. As previously stated, the promised wage that defendants were required to pay plaintiff class members under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 95-25.6 was the H-2B prevailing wage, which at all times relevant to this case exceeded the minimum wage required by federal law. Therefore, in every situation where defendants failed to pay the minimum wage, they also failed to pay the promised wage and therefore violated the NCWHA.

Defendants argue that the NCWHA is inapplicable to the claim that defendants brought the plaintiff class members' pay below the promised wage through deductions because "there is no case supporting the application of any part of the 'de facto' deduction analysis to the NCWHA." In _Frog Island Seafood,_ the court held:

> With respect to the definition of 'wages,' there is no material difference between the NCWHA and the FLSA. In particular, regulations implementing both Acts provide that an employee's wage includes the reasonable cost of furnishing board, lodging and other facilities, but excludes items which are primarily for the benefit of the employer. Accordingly, whether the issue of wages is analyzed under the FLSA or NCWHA, "there is no legal difference between deducting a cost directly from the workers' wages and shifting a cost, which they could not deduct, for the employee to bear." Under North Carolina law, therefore, this court must follow the administrative and judicial interpretations of the FLSA when considering whether Plaintiff's promised wages have been paid when due under the NCWHA.

Where, as here, the court has found a violation of the FLSA for improper deductions, be it actual or de facto, defendants are also liable for violation of the NCWHA for failing to pay the promised wage.

[4. Good Faith Defense]{.casesubsubsection}

As to the good faith defense argument made by defendants regarding the NCWHA violations, the court finds that defendants cannot meet the heavy burden required. Defendants admit they did not always pay the promised wage and do not rely on any administrative regulation or ruling in asserting this defense.

Therefore, the court GRANTS plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to defendants' liability for violation of the NCWHA.
