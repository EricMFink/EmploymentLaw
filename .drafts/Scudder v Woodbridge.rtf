The action in the court below (Chatham Superior Court) was brought by defendant in error, to recover the value of a negro boy, a carpenter, who was accidentally killed on board the steamer Ivanhoe, owned by the plaintiff in error. The boy was at work on board, and the action is sought to be sustained on the ground of carelessness on the part of the captain of the Ivanhoe, who was in the employ of the plaintiff in error, and that the plaintiff is responsible to every one, as well those in his employ as to third persons, for the carelessness of his agents.

Suppose a master carpenter, with one hundred men in his employ, responsible for their negligence to all the world, other than those in his employ, is a heavy liability. He could not trust one or more of them to build a scaffold, or do any work, lest by their neglect some of his other workmen should get injured. Nor could he trust a portion on the scaffold, lest they, by negligence, drop a piece of timber or some article, whereby another of his workmen should be injured. It may be justly asked, what rule of law makes him thus liable? It is not in their contract of hiring, nor is it implied from their contract.

But apply the rule contended for by defendant\rquote s counsel, and where will it end? Suppose the driver is injured by the breaking down of the stage, the inquiry would lead to the workmanship of the carriage-maker and the blacksmith, and all concerned in making the carriage. The inquiry would be almost endless, and quite absurd.

Now, this is exactly the view we took of this case to the jury: that the defendant had employed a mason for his captain; a black man for his engineer, and that he had not other hands on board sufficient and skillful for such a purpose; and that the injury was occasioned by the want of competent and skillful persons. The charge of the court was, that if a person did not employ proper persons to control or navigate his boat, he would be reponsible for injuries accruing thereupon; and the jury\u8212\'3fthe question of fact being left to them\u8212\'3ffound the negligence in appointing to exist.

Surely justice requires that every man who employs another in an inferior capacity, does impliedly covenant and contract that the superior agents employed to superintend him, shall be skillful aud prudent persons. Every man who holds himself out in a public or any other capacity, thereby impliedly asserts, that he is capable, and will manage properly such business. Such a warranty is implied from the mere fact of holding himself out in such capacity.

The inferior agent cannot control him in the choice of his agents; the inferior not being employed as a skillful person may not be enabled or expected to know whether the superior agent is conducting himself with skill and care, for relying on the implied warranty of the common employer; and without skill or knowledge to detect the coming evil, his first admonition may be a broken leg: shall he not recover?

Wylly Woodbridge brought an action on the case against Amos Scudder, to recover the value of a negro boy, by the name of Ned, a carpenter, killed on board the Ivanhoe, owned by the defendant. It was alleged in the declaration that the property was lost by the carelessness and mismanagement of the captain of the boat, who was employed by the owner. This boy had been hired as a carpenter to make the trip from Savannah to St. Mary\rquote s, and becoming entangled in the water-wheel, in aiding to get the boat off, he was drowned. Judge Fleming, before whom the cause was tried in Chatham county, charged the jury, that if they found that the death of the slave was occasioned by the negligence or want of skill in the officers of the Ivanhoe, in the employment of Amos Scudder, that

 The argument upon which the decisions referred to mainly rest is, that public policy requires that each person engaged on steamboats and railroads should see that every other person employed in the same service does his duty with the utmost care and vigilance; that every hand is qualified for his place, and that everything connected with the line is in good order. Moreover, it is urged, that the want of recourse on the principal will not only make each agent more careful himself, but induce him to stimulate others to like diligence. Can any of these considerations apply to slaves?

 on a bill of indictment for a misdemeanor, his conduct would have been deemed a sufficient justification for the supposed offence? No! slaves dare not intermeddle with those around, embarked in the same enterprise with themselves. Neither can they testify against their misconduct. Neither can they exercise the salutary discretion, left to free white agents, of quitting the employment when matters are mismanaged, or portend evil. Whether engaged as carpenters, bricklayers or blacksmiths\u8212\'3fas ferrymen, wagoners, patroons or private hands, in boats or vessels in the coasting or river navigation, on railroads, or any other avocation\u8212\'3fthey have nothing to do but silently serve out their appointed time, and take their lot in the mean while in submitting to whatever risks and dangers are incident to the employment. Bound to fidelity themselves, they do not, and cannot act as securities, either for the care or competency of others. And what can the master know of the condition of the vessel, road, work or machinery, where his servant is employed, or of the skill or prudence of the persons associated with him? No two conditions can be more different than these two classes of agents: namely, slaves and free white citizens; and it would be strange and extraordinary indeed if the same principle should apply to both.

We are, therefore, cordially, confidently and unanimously agreed, and so adjudge, that the judgment below be affirmed, with costs.
