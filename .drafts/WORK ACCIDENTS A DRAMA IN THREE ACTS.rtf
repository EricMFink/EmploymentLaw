His life, even before the accident, was surely very different from the comfortable life of the Chief Justice of Massachusetts. I have no idea what Farwell\u8217\'92s life was like, after he lost his case. Did he have a wife and children? How did the family manage, after the accident? The crushed hand probably made it hard for him to earn a living. Today, every legal historian knows the case and recognizes Farwell\u8217\'92s name. But at the time, this kind of recognition would have been cold comfort to Farwell and his family.}

{\*\bkmkstart co_g_ID0EABAE_1}{\*\bkmkend co_g_ID0EABAE_1}Farwell\u8217\'92s case, as we said, rested on the claim that a fellow worker was negligent; and that this negligence caused the accident. It was not an implausible claim. Normally, an employer (a \u8220\'93principal\u8221\'94) is responsible for the careless acts of an employee (an \u8220\'93agent\u8221\'94), provided these acts were done as part of the employee\u8217\'92s job. If a negligent employee of the railroad had caused an accident which injured a person who had been walking near the tracks, the victim could have sued the railroad as the \u8220\'93principal\u8221\'94 whose agent had been responsible for the plaintiff\u8217\'92s injury. But Shaw refused to apply that rule in Farwell\u8217\'92s case. One or two earlier cases seemed to be on Shaw\u8217\'92s side. The most important one was an English case, }{\hich\af5\loch\cf19\strike0\fs20\i\ulnone\ulc0\b0\f5\loch

 In practice, this shut off any chance of collecting damages in the typical case of an industrial accident. If a train, because of some sort of negligence, went off the tracks, the passengers could sue (and win, if they could show negligence), merchants who shipped goods could collect for any damage to the shipment--but a worker, who was collecting tickets in the railroad cars, had no hope of successfully suing the railroad.}

 Shaw makes this very point. Farwell\u8217\'92s wages, moreover, supposedly reflected the fact that the job was dangerous. His pay scale was assumed to take the risks into account. At least that is what Shaw implied in his opinion.}

 case, this was still an agricultural country. Industrial development was in its infancy. The railroad business was young but growing fast. Railroads were genuinely popular with farmers, merchants, and probably people in general. The railroad meant growth, it meant prosperity, it meant a market for the farmer\u8217\'92s goods. Many early cases that adopted the fellow-servant rule arose out of railroad accidents. The fellow-servant rule favored railroads over the men who worked on the railroad. In hindsight, the rule seems callous. But Shaw and his fellow-judges had no way to visualize the world of the late nineteenth century.

{\*\bkmkstart co_g_ID0EULAE_1}{\*\bkmkend co_g_ID0EULAE_1}The fellow-servant rule, of course, was not confined to railroads. And it became more and more important as industry grew in importance and in scale. The number of work accidents multiplied. In many instances, the fellow-servant rule blocked any chance the victim had to win damages. If there was negligence at all behind a work accident, it was likely to be the negligence of a fellow worker. At first, the courts stuck to the rule--a rule which they had, after all, invented. In time, however, the situation began to change.

 Some judges, it seems clear, found the rule distasteful. Plaintiffs (or their lawyers) began to explore ways to avoid or modify the rule; they searched for holes or weaknesses in the doctrinal fabric. The rule itself was, in theory, fairly clear-cut. But it began to erode under the pressure of litigation. Not many lawsuits were successful; and there was an \u8220\'93enormous disproportion\u8221\'94 between the number of lawsuits, win or lose, and the thousands and thousands of \u8220\'93work-related injuries and deaths\u8221\'94}{{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "#co_footnote_F15539209744_1" }{\fldrslt {\hich\af5\loch\hich\af5\loch\cf19\strike0\super\f5\fs16\i0\ulnone\ulc0\b0\cf19\strike0\super\fs16\i0\ulnone\ulc0\b0\f5\loch

To be sure, no two statutes were identical. In broad outline, however, they all conformed to a pattern.

 The workers got the right to recover for injuries on the job, with very few exceptions. The laws wiped out the fellow-servant rule, and the defense of contributory negligence. In exchange, labor gave up its right to sue in tort; under the law, workmen\u8217\'92s compensation was the workers\u8217\'92 exclusive remedy. An injured worker had to settle for whatever the compensation statute offered. Recovery was more or less certain--but it was also limited.}

 The mere fact that the work caused you to be in a certain place, and exposes you to a risk, even a tiny or weird or unusual risk, raises a presumption that you have a right to compensation. And if the injury is mysterious: a worker suddenly falls and breaks a leg at work, for no obvious reason, the same presumption holds. Not all courts go along with such notions, but mostly they do.

MacPherson bought the car from a dealer, not from Buick. Under the privity doctrine, he should have sued the dealer, with whom he was in \u8220\'93privity,\u8221\'94 rather than the manufacturer. This was, indeed, the law, but there were exceptions-- for products which were, for example, imminently dangerous. The privity doctrine had already shown signs of decay; courts seemed to pin the \u8220\'93dangerous\u8221\'94 label on more and more products. Cardozo gave the law a subtle twist: he expanded the category of \u8220\'93dangerous\u8221\'94 products in such a way as to include absolutely everything--if a pillow or a handkerchief caused an injury, it was to that extent a dangerous product. This meant that privity was dead. A consumer, injured by a product, could ignore \u8220\'93privity\u8221\'94 and sue the actual manufacturer.}{{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "#co_footnote_F87539209744_1" }{\fldrslt {\hich\af5\loch\hich\af5\loch\cf19\strike0\super\f5\fs16\i0\ulnone\ulc0\b0\cf19\strike0\super\fs16\i0\ulnone\ulc0\b0\f5\loch

It was easy, after all, for a person to blame psychological or emotional injury on heartless bosses, who certainly do exist. On this issue, faced with mounting premium costs, the employers fought back. Some states, giving in to the pressure, amended its law to get rid of such claims.

 There does not seem to be a major move to go back to the bad old days.

 Nonetheless, the system seems firmly entrenched, even if it is far from adequate. And the history of compensation law, despite some zigs and zags, is plainly a history of constant expansion, at least in the scope of coverage. Heart attacks, accidents at company picnics, damages for breathing foul air: these types of claims are not always successful; but it would have surprised the men and women who, appalled by the grim toll of industrial accidents, fought for the first compensation laws.}

{\*\bkmkstart co_g_ID0EC3AG_1}{\*\bkmkend co_g_ID0EC3AG_1}How can we explain the strange career of workers\u8217\'92 compensation? Or, for that matter, how can we explain the career of tort law in general, in the twentieth century--the so-called liability explosion? The liability explosion is a complex story, and I will leave it to other people to try to explain. But I would like to make a point about a facet of American political and economic life which is, I think, a small part of the explanation of the liability explosion, and a large part of the explanation of why workers\u8217\'92 compensation expanded so dramatically. The fact is that there is a gaping hole at the heart of the American welfare state. In the United States, there is no general, universal system of health insurance, no national plan on the model of the British or Canadian plans; or the plans in every other country that is part of the developed world. A country like Canada--or France, or Germany--that has some sort of plan, supported by tax-payer money, to provide free health care for everybody, is a country which does not particularly need a special scheme covering workplace accidents. Many of these countries once had a form of workers\u8217\'92 compensation.

 It may put the cost of work accidents on the employer, instead of the taxpayer. But as far as the worker is concerned, this hardly matters. It may make no practical difference to the poor soul with broken bones who slipped and fell at home on Sunday, compared to the one who slipped and fell at the office on Monday; or who suffered a heart attack while watching a movie, as opposed to an attack that happened while the worker was moving furniture at work, or operating a machine on the factory floor. In the United States it does make a difference, and often a crucial one.}

{\*\bkmkstart co_g_ID0EC6AG_1}{\*\bkmkend co_g_ID0EC6AG_1}Developed countries (other than the United States) all have, as we said, a national health system of one sort or another. That they all have such a system is not a historical accident, any more than the fact that they all provide free public school; or that women vote; or that they have adopted liberal divorce laws. They have all responded to a cluster of economic, political, and cultural factors, which are common to the developed world (and the developed parts of the undeveloped world). In many regards, the United States has gone along with global trends. There is Social Security, and no-fault divorce, and free public education. There are dozens and dozens of health and safety laws. There is deposit insurance and unemployment compensation. But with regard to health care, the country is still something of an outlier. For a variety of reasons, health care remains a complex and controversial issue. America has no national health system, on the British or Canadian model. Yet trends in health care have gone, essentially, in only one direction: edging closer toward a universal system, but never quite getting there (so far). Underlying this trend is a change in the culture: much or most of the public would like such a system; more and more people feel that health care is or should be a right, like public school education. More and more people feel health care should not be left to the whims and winds of the market. It is not easy to say exactly what accounts for this cultural change. Or whether it is likely to continue, to grow, or stay as it is. But the trend, so far, seems clear.}

{\*\bkmkstart co_g_ID0EGBBG_1}{\*\bkmkend co_g_ID0EGBBG_1}A few final comments on this three-act drama. First of all, it illustrates an old but obvious fact: legal change is a function of social change; or perhaps it might be better to say, a function of social context. The fellow servant rule was born in the early railroad days, the early days of industry. The shift to an industrial society in the end destroyed it: the terrible toll of industrial accidents made it politically toxic, and, in the end, the old rules no longer worked. Workers\u8217\'92 compensation was a way to solve the problem of the costs of industrial accidents, both for labor and for management. It did solve the problem, to a degree. The system was then caught up in our third act; and it expanded, to do its bit to fill the gaping hole in the health care system.}

{\*\bkmkstart co_g_ID0EECBG_1}{\*\bkmkend co_g_ID0EECBG_1}Is a fourth act possible? Yes: possible and even likely. The structure of the work force seems to be changing. Thousands of workers are part of the so-called gig economy. Millions of people are no longer \u8220\'93employees;\u8221\'94 they need health insurance (which can cost them dearly). For millions of people, the cost of medicine and drugs can even push them into bankruptcy. Millions are still without any health insurance. Health care is or can be a major issue. A national system might develop. In that case, it would no longer matter very much, where and when an accident occurred. A broken leg would be a broken leg, any time and any place. The United States would march in step with the rest of the developed world. Or, conceivably, time could flow backward: back to the days when there was no relief for \u8220\'93pure accidents\u8221\'94 This seems less likely. But the future is, as always, dark and unknown.}
