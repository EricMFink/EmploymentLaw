  abstract: >-
    Traditional theories of American political development depict the American
    state as a thoroughly liberal state from its very inception. In this book,
    first published in 1992, Karen Orren challenges that account by arguing that
    a remnant of ancient feudalism was, in fact, embedded in the American
    governmental system, in the form of the law of master and servant, and
    persisted until well into the twentieth century. The law of master and
    servant was, she reveals, incorporated in the US Constitution and
    administered from democratic politics. The fully legislative polity that
    defines the modern liberal state was achieved in America, Orren argues, only
    through the initiatives of the labor movement in the late nineteenth and
    early twentieth centuries, and was finally ushered in as part of the
    processes of collective bargaining instituted by the New Deal. This book
    represents a fundamental reinterpretation of constitutional change in the
    United States and of the role of American organized labor, which is shown to
    be a creator of liberalism, rather than a spoiler of socialism.
